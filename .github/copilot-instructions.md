# Python Best Practices

## Coding Style

- Follow `ruff-check` and `ruff-format` for code style and formatting using `pre-commit` hooks.
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions:
    - snake_case for functions and variables
    - PascalCase for classes
    - UPPER_CASE for constants
- Follow the Python version specified in the `pyproject.toml` or `.python-version` file.
- Use pydantic model, and all pydantic models should include `Field`, and `description` should be included.
- Maximum line length of 99 characters
- Use absolute imports over relative imports
- For tests, it should be placed in the `tests/` directory, and the test file should start with `test_`.
    - Use `assert` statements for testing conditions

### Example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class User(BaseModel):
    """Example User model.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the user
    """

    name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the user")


def foo(self, extra_input: str) -> str:
    """Example function.

    Args:
        extra_input (str): Extra input for the function

    Returns:
        str: Result of the function
    """
    return f"Hello, {self.name} and {extra_input}"
```

## Type Hints

- Use type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Use `TypeVar` for generic types
- Use `Protocol` for duck typing

## Discord Bot Development

- Use module-level variables for `SlashOption` definitions to avoid B008 linting errors
- Do not perform function calls like `SlashOption()` in argument defaults
- Create module-level singleton variables for reusable slash command options
- Follow the pattern: define options at module level, then reference them in function parameters

### SlashOption Best Practices

```python
# Define at module level
URL_OPTION = SlashOption(name="url", description="YouTube URL or search query", required=True)


# Reference in function parameter
async def play(self, interaction: Interaction, url: str = URL_OPTION) -> None:
    """Play music from YouTube"""
    pass
```

## Discord Bot Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Discord Bot built with **nextcord** (Discord.py fork) that provides AI-powered interactions, content processing, and utility features.

- **Auction Creation**: Two-step interactive process with currency selection dropdown (楓幣/雪花/台幣) followed by modal form for item details (name max 100 chars), starting price (float), bid increment (float), and duration (1-168 hours, default 24)
- **Currency Type Support**: Users can choose between "楓幣" (Mesos), "雪花" (Snowflake), and "台幣" (Taiwan Dollar) via dropdown selection with emoji indicators, with "楓幣" as default
- **Float Price Support**: All price fields (starting price, increment, bid amounts) support decimal values with proper `.2f` formatting throughout the UI
- **Auction Browsing**: Display of top 5 active auctions with dropdown selection for detailed viewing (server-specific)
- **Real-time Updates**: Live remaining time and current price displays with proper float currency formatting
- **Personal Auction Management**: View created auctions and current leading bids with currency type indication and float formatting (server-specific)

**Interactive Components:**

- **Auction Panel Buttons**: 💰 Bid (opens bid form), 📊 View Records (shows top 10 bid history), 🔄 Refresh (updates auction info)
- **Auto-Claim System**: Any button interaction on unclaimed auctions (guild_id=0) automatically assigns them to the current server
- **Bidding Rules**: Minimum bid = current price + increment, creators cannot bid on own auctions, current leaders cannot rebid, expired auctions reject bids
- **Security Features**: Self-bidding prevention, duplicate bid validation, price range validation, expiration time checks, server-specific validation
- **Guild Validation**: All commands restricted to server use only (dm_permission=False), automatic guild_id validation

**Database Architecture:**

- **auctions table**: id, guild_id (INTEGER NOT NULL), item_name, starting_price (REAL), increment (REAL), duration_hours, creator_id/name, created_at, end_time, current_price (REAL), current_bidder_id/name, is_active, currency_type
- **bids table**: id, auction_id, guild_id (INTEGER NOT NULL), bidder_id/name, amount (REAL), timestamp
- **Data Storage**: SQLite database at `data/auctions.db` with ACID compliance, automatic schema migration from INTEGER to REAL for price fields, and guild_id isolation
- **Server Isolation**: All database queries filtered by guild_id to ensure complete separation between servers
- **Auto-Claim Feature**: Unclaimed auctions (guild_id=0) are automatically assigned to the server where users interact with them
- **Currency Support**: Flexible currency type system supporting "楓幣" (Mesos), "雪花" (Snowflake), and "台幣" (Taiwan Dollar) with backward compatibility
- **Migration Support**: Robust database migration logic that handles different schema versions, missing columns with proper default values, and automatic guild_id column addition

## Change Log

### 2025-06-10 - Language Support Update

**Removed Simplified Chinese Support:**

- Removed all `Locale.zh_CN` (Simplified Chinese) translations from all cog files
- Only Traditional Chinese (`Locale.zh_TW`), Japanese (`Locale.ja`), and English (default) are now supported
- This change affects all slash commands in the following modules:
    - `auction.py` - Auction system commands
    - `gen_reply.py` - AI text generation commands
    - `maplestory.py` - MapleStory database queries
    - `music.py` - YouTube music player commands
    - `voice_recording.py` - Voice channel connection commands
    - `summary.py` - Message summarization commands
    - `gen_image.py` - Image generation commands
    - `gen_search.py` - Web search commands
    - `template.py` - Template and utility commands
    - `video.py` - Video download commands

**Japanese Translation Review:**

- Verified all Japanese translations for accuracy and proper formatting
- Fixed duplicate command names in `gen_reply.py` (changed oais command from "テキストを生成" to "リアルタイム生成")
- Confirmed all Japanese translations use appropriate:
    - Katakana for foreign words (オークション, ボリューム, ストリーム, etc.)
    - Kanji for native concepts (参加, 再生, 停止, etc.)
    - Proper honorific language (します, してください, etc.)
    - No inappropriate spaces or special characters

**Technical Impact:**

- Simplified maintenance by reducing language variants from 4 to 3
- Improved consistency in multi-language documentation
- All existing functionality remains unchanged, only language options reduced
