# 🔒 Privacy & Data

This Discord bot complies with Discord’s Terms of Service and Developer Policy.

## 📦 Data Collection and Usage

- **Local Message Logging**: By default, messages in channels where the bot is present are logged to a local SQLite database at `./data/messages.db` (author, content, timestamps, attachments/stickers). This remains on your server and is not shared externally.
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: Aside from calling trusted APIs (e.g., OpenAI) to fulfill requests, data is not shared with third parties.
- **Opt-out**: Server owners can disable logging by removing the logging calls in `src/discordbot/cli.py` or adapting `src/discordbot/sdk/log_message.py`.

## ⚙️ Bot Permissions and Intents

This bot uses certain Discord intents solely to provide its core features:

- **Message Content Intent**: Required for slash-command context, limited keyword handling, and optional local logging as described above.
- **Slash Commands**: Used for interactive and explicit command triggers.
- **Embed Links / File Attachments**: Used to display structured output and allow interaction with visual content.
- **Presence Intent (if applicable)**: May be used to improve responsiveness based on online status; not stored.

Users may opt out of interactions via commands like `!optout` (planned) or by muting the bot.

## 🔐 Data Security

- All API requests are made via secure HTTPS connections.
- Data is processed only temporarily in memory and never stored on disk or external databases.
- No long-term logs or analytics based on message or user content are maintained.

## 📬 Contact and Compliance

If you have privacy concerns or questions about this policy, feel free to:

- Submit an issue via GitHub
- Contact the developer through the repository's listed channels

This bot is designed using **privacy-by-design principles** with a strict minimal-data-handling approach to protect all users.
